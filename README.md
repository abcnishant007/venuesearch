# venuesearch

### usage:
1. The references must be copied to a text file (Suggestion, open using word, then copy to vim/gedit/notepad to remove any formatting)
2. The generated output is sorted according to name to reveal common venues (the file type is .csv so that any resideual soritng can be done Excel etc..)

### Considerations 
1. Reading from pdf is not implemented yet 
2ArXiV's will just show up at AxXiV; No google search is done


### Improvements
1. If the references has italics for the venue: (Bingo, we can use that :)
